# LiveSpec
A re-imagining of rSpec in a living Dynabook environment.

The LiveSpec code is hosted [on Smalltalk Hub](http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~SeanDeNigris/LiveSpec/). The code in this repo is a WIP reference implementation of the code from [The rSpec Book](https://pragprog.com/book/achbd/the-rspec-book). The plan is to go along with the book and, as a first step, make LiveSpec produce output compatible with Cucumber. We say compatible because e.g. for now we are not profiling, so there is no `0.009s`.
